## kinnie - a minimalist interpreted programming language written in C

The interpreter is available for download in the **Releases** tab. However, if you want to compile it yourself, feel free to do so. Once you have the interpreter, to run the `example.kn` file, simply type the command `./kinnie example.kn` or, if you are using Windows, `./kinnie.exe example.kn`. <br>

kinnie has an **extension for Visual Studio Code** that allows keyword highlighting and suggestions. You can download it from the kinnie-vsc repository, also from the **Releases** tab.
